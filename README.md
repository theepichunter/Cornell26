#Pool Project

Authors: Jeremy Shen, Hunter Pesin

Description: Python program that emulates a rudimentary version of 8ball 
using the physics of simple collisions. 

Installation Requirements: Unix

Usage: Before starting the users are prompted to set the friction
coefficient and elasticity constant.* To hit the cue ball while playing, the 
player clicks in the direction that they wish to hit the ball. The distance 
between the click and the cue ball determines the magnitude of the 
impulse applied.

Refer to attached video for a video demonstration of gameplay

Press Q twice while the balls are moving to quit the game. While doing so, plots of total kinetic energy and trajectory of the center of mass throughout the game will appear.

*Make sure to drag in order to set the sliders. 

Limitations: The simulation doesn't take into account rolling vs sliding; itâ€™s 
assumed that all balls are sliding across the table. The runtime speed is also 
fairly slow, and each turn takes quite long to end.
